This project focuses on two main tasks: zero-shot image segmentation and generating new camera views of objects. Follow the instructions below to set up and run the tasks.



Before running the scripts, ensure you have Python in your system
```

```bash
conda create -n new_env python=3.9
conda activate new_env
pip install --upgrade -q git+https://github.com/huggingface/transformers
```

Next, install the additional required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```



### Task 1: Zero-Shot Image Segmentation

To perform zero-shot image segmentation, use the following command:

```bash
python run1.py --image /home/vaibhavsharma/Desktop/rfp/unstructured_excels/segment_anything/inputs/office_chair.jpeg --object office_chair --output /home/vaibhavsharma/Desktop/rfp/unstructured_excels/segment_anything/task1_outputs/office_chair_segmented.jpg
```

This script will segment the specified object (`office_chair`) in the given image and save the output to the specified location.

### Task 2: Generate New Camera View of Object

To generate a new camera view of an object, run the following command:

```bash
python run2.py --image /home/vaibhavsharma/Desktop/rfp/unstructured_excels/segment_anything/inputs/lamp.jpeg --object lamp --output /home/vaibhavsharma/Desktop/rfp/unstructured_excels/segment_anything/task2_outputs/lamp_flipped.jpg
```

This script processes the image to create a new view of the `lamp` and saves the result to the designated output directory.
